        <h4>The Sun Also Rises (1926):</h4>
        <blockquote>No amount of analysis can convey the quality of <em>'The Sun Also Rises'</em>. It is a truly gripping story, told in a lean, hard, athletic, narrative prose that puts more literary English to shame... This novel is unquestionably one of the events
          of an unusually rich year in literature.</blockquote><br>
        <h4>To Have and Have Not (1937):</h4>
        <blockquote>He has moved steadily towards mastery of his technique... Technique however is not enough to make a great writer... There is evidence of no mental growth whatever; there is no better understanding in life... Essentially, this new novel is an empty
          book. - J. Donald Adams</blockquote>
